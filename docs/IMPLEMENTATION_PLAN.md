# Sessions 3-12 Implementation Plan

## 🎯 What Has Been Created

### ✅ Complete Master Outline
I've created `SESSIONS_3-12_MASTER_OUTLINE.md` which contains:
- Detailed learning objectives for all 10 remaining sessions
- Core PyTorch functions for each session
- Specific book chapter references
- Exercise outlines (6-8 per session)
- Genomics applications
- Estimated durations
- 3 Capstone project descriptions

### 📊 Content Summary
- **10 Sessions** (3-12) fully outlined
- **~75 exercises** planned across all sessions
- **35-45 hours** of learning content
- **Complete progression** from neural networks to deployment

## 🚀 Recommended Approach

Given the extensive content needed (each session is 40-50KB), here are your options:

### Option 1: Generate Sessions Incrementally (Recommended)
Ask me to generate sessions one at a time as you complete them:
1. Complete Sessions 1-2 ✅
2. Ask: "Generate Session 3 in full detail"
3. Complete Session 3
4. Ask: "Generate Session 4 in full detail"
5. And so on...

**Benefits**:
- Full detail for each session
- No token limitations
- Can adjust based on feedback
- Always get the latest/best version

### Option 2: Batch Generation
Ask for multiple sessions at once:
- "Generate Sessions 3-5 in full detail" (takes ~30min)
- "Generate Sessions 6-8 in full detail" (takes ~30min)
- etc.

**Benefits**:
- Get multiple sessions at once
- Can work offline
- Have material ahead

### Option 3: Use the Master Outline + Fill In
Use the master outline I created as a template and:
- Follow the structure provided
- Implement exercises based on descriptions
- Reference the book chapters cited
- Use similar patterns from Sessions 1-2

**Benefits**:
- Learn by implementing yourself
- Customize to your needs
- Deeper understanding

## 🎓 Session-by-Session Priorities

### High Priority (Core Skills)
**Session 3: Neural Networks** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Foundation for all future sessions
- Most important after Sessions 1-2
- **Recommend generating first**

**Session 4: CNNs** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Critical for sequence analysis
- Used in many genomics applications
- **Generate second**

**Session 5: RNNs** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Important for sequential data
- **Generate third**

### Medium Priority (Advanced Architectures)
**Session 6: Transfer Learning** ⭐⭐⭐
- Practical but can wait
- **Generate fourth or fifth**

**Session 7: Transformers** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Very hot topic
- Complex but powerful
- **Generate when ready for advanced topics**

### Specialized Topics (Can Be Generated As Needed)
**Sessions 8-10: Generative Models** ⭐⭐⭐
- VAEs, GANs, Diffusion
- Specialized applications
- **Generate when interested in generation**

**Sessions 11-12: Production** ⭐⭐
- Optimization and deployment
- Practical for real applications
- **Generate last**

## 📚 How to Use the Master Outline

### For Self-Study:
1. Open the master outline
2. Read the objectives for a session
3. Look up the referenced book chapters
4. Try implementing exercises yourself
5. Use Sessions 1-2 as patterns
6. Ask me for specific help when stuck

### For Instructor-Led:
1. Read through outline
2. Request: "Generate Session X with full exercises and solutions"
3. Receive complete 40-50KB session file
4. Work through exercises
5. Move to next session

### For Quick Reference:
- Check what functions you'll learn
- See what genomics applications are covered
- Understand prerequisites
- Plan your learning path

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Efficient Learning:
1. **Don't rush** - Master each session before moving on
2. **Do exercises** - Don't just read, code!
3. **Use both books** - Cross-reference the chapters cited
4. **Experiment** - Modify code, try different approaches
5. **Build projects** - Apply to your own genomics problems

### For Best Results:
1. **Complete Sessions 1-2 first** - Foundation is critical
2. **Request Session 3 next** - It's the most important
3. **Go in order** - Each builds on previous ones
4. **Take notes** - Document your learning
5. **Share your work** - Put on GitHub, get feedback
